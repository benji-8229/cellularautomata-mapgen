## Explanation
This is a simple implementaion of cellular automata as a means for procedural level generation in video games. It shows well how a basic script can create well proportioned maps with organic shapes. Made in Unity.

In the video above we see the multiple steps of the cellular automata, followed by a cleanup step where we only keep the largest cave, and then finally placing objects inside our final map.
